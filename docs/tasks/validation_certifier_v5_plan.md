# Validation Certifier v5.0 Tasks

This document tracks upcoming enhancements referenced in `validation_certifier.py`.

## Overview
The v5.0 roadmap introduces several major capabilities:

1. **Machine Learning Detection** – advanced pattern recognition using trained models.
2. **Dashboard** – real-time monitoring UI for validations and integrity metrics.
3. **External Reputation Integration** – sync validator reputation from outside systems.
4. **Semantic Analysis** – sentence embedding comparisons for deeper note insights.
5. **Validator Onboarding** – automated guidance and training recommendations.

The tasks below break down these features and suggest initial API endpoints or modules.

---

### Priority 1 – Machine Learning Detection
* **Description**: Implement models that detect anomalous validation patterns or coordinated manipulation attempts.
* **Proposed Module**: `ml_detection.py`
* **Initial API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v5/ml/detect` – accepts a batch of validations and returns anomaly scores and features.
* **Next Steps**:
  - Research suitable algorithms (e.g., IsolationForest, LSTM-based sequence models).
  - Provide training data pipeline within `scripts/train_ml_models.py`.
  - Integrate detection results into `run_full_integrity_analysis`.

### Priority 2 – Real-Time Dashboard
* **Description**: Provide a web interface showing live validation submissions, consensus trends, and integrity metrics.
* **Proposed Module**: `dashboard/routes.py` and `dashboard/views/`.
* **Initial API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /dashboard` – serve the dashboard UI.
  - `GET /api/v5/dashboard/metrics` – JSON feed of recent validations and scores.
* **Next Steps**:
  - Utilize WebSockets for live updates.
  - Reuse NiceGUI or similar framework from `transcendental_resonance_frontend`.

### Priority 3 – External Reputation Integration
* **Description**: Pull validator reputation data from third‑party systems (e.g., ORCID, Publons) to augment existing scores.
* **Proposed Module**: `reputation/external_sync.py`.
* **Initial API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v5/reputation/import` – submit credentials or tokens to fetch and merge external reputation data.
* **Next Steps**:
  - Define mapping between external reputation metrics and internal scores.
  - Schedule periodic sync with background tasks.

### Priority 4 – Semantic Analysis
* **Description**: Use sentence embeddings to compare validation notes for similarity, contradiction, or novelty.
* **Proposed Module**: `semantic_analyzer.py`.
* **Initial API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v5/semantic/analyze` – returns embedding vectors and pairwise similarity metrics.
* **Next Steps**:
  - Evaluate libraries like `sentence-transformers`.
  - Integrate with `score_validation` to enhance note sentiment scoring.

### Priority 5 – Validator Onboarding
* **Description**: Automate validator onboarding with training material recommendations based on expertise gaps and past performance.
* **Proposed Module**: `onboarding/recommendations.py`.
* **Initial API Endpoint**: `GET /api/v5/onboarding/tips?validator_id=<id>` – retrieves personalized training suggestions.
* **Next Steps**:
  - Maintain a knowledge base of resources.
  - Track validator progress and adjust recommendations accordingly.

These tasks should be created as GitHub issues or added to the project backlog. They can be addressed independently but share dependencies on the new v5 API namespace.
